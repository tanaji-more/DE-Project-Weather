In this groundbreaking AWS Data Engineering series, we delve into the intricacies of building a robust real-time data pipeline using DynamoDB, Snowflake, and AWS Lambda. The content unfolds as a captivating narrative, showcasing hands-on demonstrations, step-by-step tutorials, and expert insights.

A)Introduction to DynamoDB and Snowflake Integration: Explore the fundamentals of DynamoDB and Snowflake, understanding their unique strengths and how they seamlessly integrate to form a powerful data ecosystem.

B)Leveraging AWS Lambda Functions: Witness the dynamic capabilities of AWS Lambda as we demonstrate its role in orchestrating the real-time flow of data. Learn how to design Lambda functions that efficiently process and transmit data.

C)Ingesting Real-Time Data from a Weather API: Step into the world of real-time data by integrating a weather API. Follow along as we guide you through the process of ingesting this data into DynamoDB, setting the stage for the next level of data processing.

D)Seamless Transmission to Snowflake using Snowpipe: Experience the magic of Snowpipe as we showcase its role in seamlessly transmitting data from DynamoDB to Snowflake in real-time. Learn how to optimize this process for maximum efficiency.

E)Optimizing and Scaling the Data Pipeline: Delve into best practices for optimizing and scaling your data pipeline. Explore strategies to enhance performance, ensure data integrity, and accommodate the evolving needs of your projects.

F)Troubleshooting and Best Practices: Equip yourself with troubleshooting skills and industry best practices to overcome common challenges in real-world scenarios. Learn how to ensure the reliability and resilience of your data pipeline.

G)Advanced Concepts and Future Trends: Explore advanced concepts and emerging trends in AWS Data Engineering. Stay ahead of the curve by understanding the latest technologies and their potential impact on data engineering practices.

Steps:

1. Create Lambda function (For lambda function you need to create DyanamoDB Table first) and Fetch data from Weather API
2. Fetched data put into DynamoDB
3. after fetched succesfully data into DyanoDB 
4. Create S3 Bucket
5. After S3 bucket data fetched into snowflake
6. and now create schedule for every 1 hour for automatic data insertion into snowflake
