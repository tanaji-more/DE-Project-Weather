Steps:

1. Create Lambda function (For lambda function you need to create DyanamoDB Table first) and Fetch data from Weather API
2. Fetched data put into DynamoDB
3. after fetched succesfully data into DyanoDB 
4. Create S3 Bucket
5. After S3 bucket data fetched into snowflake
6. and now create schedule for every 1 hour for automatic data insertion into snowflake

Weather API Data Integration with AWS and Snowflake.

1. Fetched real-time weather data using Weather API and stored it in an AWS DynamoDB table.
2. Developed a Python-based Lambda function to process the Weather API data and store the output in AWS S3.
3. Leveraged DynamoDB Streams to capture changes and load data into AWS S3 automatically.
4. Configured Snowflake external stages to fetch data from S3, enabling seamless integration for data analysis.
5. Created and managed IAM roles and policies for secure access between AWS and Snowflake.
6. Automated hourly data ingestion into Snowflake using EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) to schedule Lambda executions.
7. Successfully implemented end-to-end data pipeline from API to Snowflake, enhancing real-time weather data analytics.
